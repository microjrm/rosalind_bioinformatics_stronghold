# rosalind_bioinformatics_stronghold
These are all of my solutions to the problems presented in the Bioinformatics Stronghold at ROSALIND

ROSALIND is a project dedicated to teaching the inner workings of bioinformatics using python.  The exercises start at the beginner
level and progressively get more difficult.  My goal is to complete each problem set and upload my code to a respective folder in 
this repository.  

Problems:
1. Counting DNA Nucleotides
